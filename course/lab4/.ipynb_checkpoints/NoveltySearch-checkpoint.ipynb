    "### Lab goals\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand how novelty search operates at a detailed enough level to successfully implement it.\n",
    "2. Develop unit tests to ensure that your implementation operates correctly.\n",
    "3. Develop analysis tools to monitor search results.\n",
    "4. Use randomness to generate larger-scale tests, and experiment with search parameters.\n",

    "### Getting started\n",

    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Novelty search is a method of searching for a variety of solutions rather than trying to optimize a particular goal. To do this, novelty search maintains an *archive* of behaviors, comparing current behaviors against the saved ones to determine whether a current behavior is novel enough to add to the archive.  A current behavior's novelty is defined as the **average distance** to its **k** nearest neighbors in the archive.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be representing a *behavior* as a **list of points**, where points may be of some arbitrary dimension, and the list may be of some arbitrary length. For example, consider the coverage task that we worked on in the previous lab.  One way to represent the behavior of a robot in this task is to record the **new** grid locations it visits in order.  The length of this particular behavior space will be the total number of grid locations, which for a 15x15 grid is 225.  The length of each point in this behavior space will be 2, representing the (x, y) location of each grid square.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Implement the NoveltySearch class\n",
    "\n",
    "* **constructor**:\n",
    "Create class variables to store the **archive** as an initially empty list, the **k** (an\n",
    "integer) to be used in calculating nearest neighbors, the **limit** (an integer) for the maximum size of the archive, the **threshold** (a float) for how novel an example has to be before it will be added the archive, and the **max_dist** (a number) for the maximum possible distance between any two behaviors in the archive.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **point_dist**:\n",
    "Returns the Euclidean distance between points **p1** and **p2**, which are assumed to be lists of equal length. To calculate distance, sum up the squared differences between each component of the points. Return the square root of this sum.  *This method should work for points of any length.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **behavior_dist**:\n",
    "Returns the sum of the point distances between behaviors **b1** and **b2**, which are assumed to be lists of points of equal length. *This method should work for behaviors of any length.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **k_nearest_dist**:\n",
    "For the given **behavior**, returns the sum of the behavior distances to its **k** nearest neighbors in the archive. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **sparseness**:\n",
    "For the given **behavior**, returns the **normalized** average distance (based on the **max_dist**) to its **k** nearest neighbors in the archive.  If the archive is empty, then return 1.0.  If the archive has less than **k** behaviors, the use the archive's current size to compute the average distance. The sparseness of a behavior will represent its novelty.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **check_archive**:\n",
    "This method checks whether the given **behavior** is novel enough to add to the archive and returns its **sparseness**. The parameter **other_info** can be used to store additional information along with the behavior in the archive. This will be helpful when doing analyses of the evolutionary run, once it completes. The archive is represented as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a behavior, its sparseness, and the its other associated information.  The behavior at the front of the archive is the oldest, and the behavior at the end of the archive is the newest. When the size of the archive is less than **k**, then add the given behavior to the archive. Otherwise check if the **sparseness** of the given behavior is greater than the **threshold**, and if so, add the behavior to the archive. After adding a behavior, test if the archive size has exceeded the **limit**, and if so, remove the oldest behavior from the archive. \n",

    "You will implement these methods later.\n",

You'll need to determine the **max_dist** for these behaviors, and you will experiment with the threshold setting. Loop 500 times, generating a random behavior and calling the **check_archive** method.  After the loop, call the **plot_growth** and **plot_behaviors** methods to see the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the sparseness values are normalized, so the threshold setting should be a value in the range **[0,1]**. Smaller thresholds should lead to the archive reaching the limit in size more quickly.  For high enough thresholds, the archive may never reach its size limit.  What threshold value(s) seem to strike the best balance of using the capacity of the archive at a reasonable pace? You should run multiple experiments at each threshold setting. Include a markdown table showing your results. "
