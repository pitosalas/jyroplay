    "In this notebook you will learn how to use [conx](http://conx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to create, train, and test simple neural networks.  The conx library is built on top of [keras](https://keras.io/), which is in turn built on top of [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining a Network\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps you need to go through to create a neural network in conx.\n",
    "1. Import the *conx* library.\n",
    "2. Construct a *Network* object.\n",
    "3. Add layers to the *Network*, starting with the input and ending with the output. For any non-input layer, specify the size of each layer as well as the activation function to use.  \n",
    "4. Connect the layers.\n",
    "5. Compile the network, giving it a *loss* and *optimizer*.  Below we use the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with a particular learning rate (lr) and momentum.\n",
    "6. Verify that the *Network* has the correct structure by creating a summary of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our first conx network we will be learning logical OR, which will take 2 input values reprenting True/False and outputs True/False. "
